# n2o4

The `n2o4` crate provides safe, (ideally) idiomatic Rust bindings
to [cFE](https://github.com/nasa/cFE)
and [OSAL](https://github.com/nasa/osal) APIs.

**NOTE:** this is a work in progress,
and bindings for many APIs don't currently exist.

## Using this crate in your cFS app

See [USING.md](USING.md) for how to set everything up to
